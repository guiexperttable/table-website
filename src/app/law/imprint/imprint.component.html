  <h2>Disclaimer – Legal Notices</h2>

  § 1 Disclaimer of Liability for Content<br />
  The free and freely accessible content of this website has been created with the utmost care. However, the provider of
  this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the provided free and freely accessible journalistic
  guides and news articles. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always
  the opinion of the provider. The mere access to the free and freely accessible content does not create any contractual
  relationship between the user and the provider; in this respect, the intention to create legal relations on the part
  of the provider is lacking.<br />
  <br />

  § 2 External Links<br />
  This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are the responsibility of the
  respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the external content for any
  legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and
  future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts
  the content behind the reference or link as its own. Continuous monitoring of external links is not reasonable for the
  provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, if legal violations become known, such external links
  will be deleted immediately.<br />
  <br />

  § 3 Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights<br />
  The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and intellectual property rights. Any use not
  permitted by German copyright and intellectual property law requires the prior written consent of the provider or
  respective rights holder. This applies in particular to reproduction, editing, translation, storage, processing, or
  playback of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Third-party content and rights are identified
  as such. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of individual content or complete pages is not permitted and is
  punishable by law. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private, and non-commercial use is
  allowed.<br />
  <br />
  The presentation of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.<br />
  <br />

  § 4 Special Terms of Use<br />
